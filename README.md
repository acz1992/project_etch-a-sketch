# project_etch-a-sketch

A simple web-based Etch-a_Sketch App

Things still do do:

SORT BUGS
-When shadeMode activated, borders disappear. When general border styling added to mode, it prevents the opacity from getting dark after the click event

STYLING
-Design it so the Grid appears on a Div that resembles an Etch-a-sketch toy.
-Place mode buttons on the side

EXTRA FEATURES
-Utilise "Input-color" HTML feature so that in normalMode and shadeMode, the user can change the colour.
